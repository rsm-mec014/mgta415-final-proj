## Does deep learning models always achieve higher accuracy in multi-class prediction, comparing to traditional machine learning models?

In this study, we tried to explore whether deep learning models always performs better than traditional machine learning algorithms, including tf-idf and Word2Vec.

With **deep learning** models, we combined embedding with classification task into one neural network. For machine learning algorithms, we built classification models (e.g. logistic regression and random forest) trained by embedded vectors using tf-idf or Word2Vec.
